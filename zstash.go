// Package zstash provides a library for saving and restoring cache archives
// to/from cloud storage with the Buildkite cache API.
//
// The main entry point is NewCache, which creates a Cache client for managing
// cache operations. The Cache client is safe for concurrent use by multiple
// goroutines.
//
// Basic usage:
//
//	client := api.NewClient(ctx, version, endpoint, token)
//	cacheClient, err := zstash.NewCache(zstash.Config{
//	    Client:       client,
//	    BucketURL:    "s3://my-bucket",
//	    Branch:       "main",
//	    Pipeline:     "my-pipeline",
//	    Organization: "my-org",
//	    Caches: []cache.Cache{
//	        {ID: "node_modules", Key: "v1-{{ checksum \"package-lock.json\" }}", Paths: []string{"node_modules"}},
//	    },
//	})
//	if err != nil {
//	    log.Fatal(err)
//	}
//
//	// Save a cache
//	result, err := cacheClient.Save(ctx, "node_modules")
//
//	// Restore a cache
//	result, err := cacheClient.Restore(ctx, "node_modules")
